Clojure UI testing with Chrome

## Motivation

I needed a library for writing robust and maintainable UI tests for my work 
and hobby Clojure(Script) projects. The library had to run on top of the 
JVM to simplify test setups and enable code sharing between the tests and 
the application, but without the annoying WebDriver version hassle. 

The design of the current version of `cuic` is the result of countless 
(re)written tests, various attempts to structure test code and hours
after hours of CI test runs, driven by the following core principles:

  * Utilization of Clojure core data structures and control flow instead 
    of custom macros and DSLs
  * Minimal and unambiguous but easily extendable API surface 
  * Seamless integration with `clojure.test` and the tooling around it
  * First class REPL usage

## Show me the code!

Here's a small snippet showing how to test the classic
[TodoMVC app](http://todomvc.com/examples/react) with `cuic`

```clojure 
(ns example-todomvc-tests
 (:require [clojure.test :refer :all]
           [cuic.core :as c]
           [cuic.test :refer [deftest* is* browser-test-fixture]]))

(use-fixtures
 :once
 (browser-test-fixture))

(defn todos []
 (->> (c/query ".todo-list li")
      (map c/text-content)))

(defn add-todo [text]
 (doto (c/find ".new-todo")
   (c/fill text))
 (c/press 'Enter))

(deftest* creating-new-todos
 (c/goto "http://todomvc.com/examples/react")
 (is* (= [] (todos)))
 (add-todo "Hello world!")
 (is* (= ["Hello world!"] (todos)))
 (add-todo "Tsers!")
 (is* (= ["Hello world!" "Tsers!"] (todos))))
```

## Documentation

Each `cuic` function has a Clojure doc-string describing its behaviour and usage. 
Generated API docs and guides are also available as **[cljdoc](https://cljdoc.org/d/cuic/cuic)**.
